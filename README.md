# Replicaaaaa

> Status: Prototype!

Replica is a platform for interoperable, local first data built on top of CRDTs. You have a personal set of documents and data, which can be replicated between your devices. The data is collaboratively editable between your phone and your laptop, or your phone and my phone.

Replica is still in early development, and this is an early prototype of the code. Please don't expect too much yet! Most of the "hard" CRDT work is happening in the [diamond-types](https://github.com/josephg/diamond-types) library.
